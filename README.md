# EmergingDev Assignment 2

## Project Overview
This repository contains projects developed as part of the Emerging Developers assignment. The projects included demonstrate various technologies and concepts in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SushmaKambam/emergingdev_assignment2.git
    cd emergingdev_assignment2
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    - For the Self-Driving Car Project:
      ```sh
      cd Part-1_self_driving_car
      ```
      Open `index.html` in your browser.
    - For the Real Estate Price Prediction App:
      ```sh
      cd Part2_react-brainjs-realestate-predictor
      npm install
      npm start
      ```
      Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Features & Technologies Used
### Self-Driving Car Project
- **No Libraries**: Built with pure JavaScript.
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes a neural network for decision-making.
- **Visual Simulation**: Real-time rendering of the car, road, and obstacles.

### Real Estate Price Prediction App
- **Price Prediction**: Uses machine learning to predict real estate prices.
- **User Feedback**: Allows users to submit feedback to improve predictions.
- **Data Management**: Uses IndexedDB for storing user data.

### Technologies Used
